Server must be updated to handle cropped images.\n\n## Context\n\nThe Chrome extension is changing from sending full viewport screenshots to sending pre-cropped images. This is a **BREAKING CHANGE** requiring coordinated deployment.\n\n**Benefits**:\n- 75-90% bandwidth reduction (500KB → 50KB typical)\n- 98%+ Gemini API token cost reduction\n- Faster uploads on slow connections\n- Better UX (no modal loading overlay)\n\n## Changes Required on Server\n\n### 1. Update API Contract Expectations\n\n**Current**: Server receives full viewport screenshot + selection region coordinates\n**New**: Server receives ONLY the cropped selection area\n\nThe selection region metadata will still be sent, but:\n- Image is already cropped to that selection\n- Image coordinates start at (0, 0), not (selection.x, selection.y)\n- `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight` are deprecated (ignore if present)\n\n### 2. Update Gemini Prompt\n\n**Current prompt** (identify-phrase.ts:144-154):\n```typescript\nUser selected region: x=${params.selectionRegion.x}, y=${params.selectionRegion.y},\nwidth=${params.selectionRegion.width}, height=${params.selectionRegion.height}\nImage size: ${params.imageWidth}x${params.imageHeight}\n\nIdentify the Japanese phrase in or near this region.\n```\n\n**New prompt** should be:\n```typescript\nImage size: ${params.imageWidth}x${params.imageHeight}\n\nIdentify the primary Japanese phrase in this image.\nThe entire image contains the user's selection.\nProvide precise bounding box coordinates (normalized 0-1000 relative to this image).\n```\n\n### 3. Remove Selection Region Coordinate Transformations\n\n**Current** (identify-phrase.ts:140-156):\n- Calculates `imageWidth` and `imageHeight` from `viewportWidth * devicePixelRatio`\n- Transforms `selectionRegion` coordinates by multiplying by `devicePixelRatio`\n- Passes transformed coordinates to Gemini service\n\n**New**:\n- Image dimensions ARE the selection dimensions (already cropped)\n- Calculate: `imageWidth = selection.width * devicePixelRatio`\n- Calculate: `imageHeight = selection.height * devicePixelRatio`\n- NO coordinate transformation needed (image is already the selection)\n\n### 4. Bounding Box Response Format\n\n**No changes needed** - continue returning normalized [x, y, width, height] coordinates (0-1000 scale).\n\nThe extension will handle reconstruction to viewport coordinates using the original selection offset.\n\n## NO Backward Compatibility\n\nDo NOT add backward compatibility logic. This is a clean break:\n- Old extension clients will break after server update\n- New extension requires new server\n- Deploy both together\n\n## Design Documentation\n\nExtension design updated at:\n- `/home/agus/workspace/asermax/shin-sekai/01_Projects/yomitoku/design/api-integration.md`\n\nRead the \"Screenshot Capture Flow\" and \"Cost Optimization Strategy\" sections for full context.\n\n## Action Items\n\nAs the server agent, you should:\n1. Read the updated design documentation (paths above)\n2. Create implementation beads for all required server changes\n3. Prioritize these beads at priority 0 (same as extension epic)\n4. Verify no backward compatibility is added\n5.
